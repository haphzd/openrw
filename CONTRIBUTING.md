## How to contribute
If you can write source code to implement missing features or fix bugs, changes
can be submitted for review via github's pull requests system.

If you aren't able to contibute source code, we are also happy to see improved
documentation of the expected behaviour on sites like the gtamodding wiki.
Improving this documentation makes it easier to implement the correct behaviour.

## Submitting Pull Requests

If you are submitting a pull request for OpenRW:

1. Include a reference to any issue the pull request is intended to address.
2. Submit unrelated changes in different pull requests.
3. If you aren't ready to merge your changes but are looking for feedback, include "[not ready]" in the title.
4. Changes in behaviour should be shown to match the behaviour in the original game, if applicable.
5. Ensure that the test suite still passes after your change, updating tests if required.

## Guidelines
### What will be accepted
* Changes that increase compatibility with the game data.
* Fixes for technical issues, such as wide-screen or UHD resolution support.
* Feature enhancements, such as improved support for different input schemes.

### What will not be accepted
* Changes where the ownership of the code is in question.
* Changes to support non-GTA titles.

## Evaluating pull requests

When a pull request is submitted, at least two members of the organisation should have reviewed the changes before merging.
